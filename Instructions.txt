Instructions for the Shenanigans Music Player

	The Shenanigans Music Player supports playback of music encoded in a custom text format. This text
can be read from a file or entered into the command console of the MARS++ simulator. MARS++ can be downloaded
from http://karnbianco.co.uk/blog/2010/11/12/mips-assembly-music-sequencer/. Starting the player will ask for
a format you want to read music from. Once you select your format, you will be prompted for a file name or a
string of music. Music is written as successive notes and commands (which can be seperated by spaces and/or newlines)
The format for music is as follows:

Note format:
	<note pitch><*flat or sharp><*note octave><note duration><*dot>
	* indicates optional character

	<note pitch>
		Represented by a letter a-g, indicating the concert pitch of the note. An uppercase letter
		will play one octave higher than a lowercase letter. An 'r' denotes a rest.
	<flat or sharp>
		flat character- b
		sharp character- #
		Optional character which will augment the pitch by a half step (up for #, down for b)
	<note octave>
		Optional character declaring the note's octave (defaults to 4 if not specified). Note that an uppercase
		letter for note pitch will add 1 to this value. For reference, "middle C" on a piano is
		octave 4.
	<note duration>
		Represented by a character indicating the kind of note to be played.
			32nd note:  t
			16th note:  s
			8th note:   e
			triplet:    r
			1/4 note:   q
			1/2 note:   h
			whole note: w
	<dot>
		An optional character. A '.' indicates a dotted note. This extends a note's duration by 50%.
	Examples
		f#5h.
			A dotted-half (3 beat) concert f# played in the 5th octave
		A2q
			A quarter note concert a played in the 3rd octave
		rw
			A whole rest

Chord format:
	(<full note>, <pitch>, ..., <pitch>)
	
	<full note>
		A note written according to the above note format. This duration will be the duration of
		the entire chord.
	<pitch>
		Just the pitch of a note. This corresonds to <note pitch><*flat or charp><*note octave>
		in the note format.
	Examples
		(E4h, Ab4, B4)
		An E major chord played in the 5th octave played for a half note.

Command format:
	{<char>=<value>}

	Set tempo command
		{t=<tempo>}
		Sets the tempo to the integer <tempo>. <tempo> should represent the speed of the music in
		beats per minute, assuming a quarter note is one beat. The default starting tempo is 90
		beats per minute.
	Set volume command
		{v=<dynamic>}
		Sets the volume to the string <dynamic>. <dynamic> is as string representing the volume of
		the music. In order of increasing voulme, the supported dynamics are:
			ppp
			pp
			p
			mf
			f
			ff
			fff
		The default starting dynamic is mf.
	Set instrument command
		{i=<instr>}
		Sets the instrument to the one specified by the integer <instr>. For a list of instruments
		and there corresponding values go to http://www.midi.org/techspecs/gm1sound.php. The default
		starting instrument is acoustic grand piano.
	Examples
		{t=120}
			Set tempo to 120 beats per minute (quarter note = 120)
		{v=ff}
			Set volume to ff (fortissimo)
		{i=71}
			Set instrument to basson.
